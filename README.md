### About me

My journey into programming started in 2016-2017 during my high school years, when I learned the basics of the C language. I was fascinated by the ability to turn mathematical ideas into tangible creations on the screen.
I quickly realized that programming involves more than just applying mathematical concepts: it is a discipline that entails solving real, complex problems in a logical and creative manner, and actively shaping the digital world.
To confirm my career direction, I attended a five-month web development boot camp at Wild Code School. This experience strengthened my decision to become a web developer. Now, at ADA Tech School, I am sharpening my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem.
I have contributed to several team projects, including an application built with Vite, TypeScript, and React to visualize data on missing persons registered in the FBI system. This project allowed me to work on API calls while enhancing my teamwork and agile skills.
