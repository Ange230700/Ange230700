### About me

I'm an aspiring full-stack Typescript developer trying to build real products that solve real problems — from web to mobile to desktop. My focus is simple: create clean systems, elegant interfaces, and long-term digital foundations that actually move businesses, ideas forward.

Right now, I'm leading a 12-month, end-to-end solo project: an all-in-one platform for a couture atelier in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa.

Beyond all that, I'm building V∅ID, my personal brand as a techie, dedicated to the idea of building from nothing. Minimalism, precision, consistency, and discipline guide how I design, code, and lead projects.

At the core, I'm aspiring to be a builder. If a solution doesn't exist, let's find a way to create it. If a system is messy, let's architect it. If a product has no direction, let's find one.

I'm always open to connecting with other developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and product-minded builders.
