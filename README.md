### About me

Having always been fascinated by the Internet, which I consider to be mankind's greatest invention, I discovered programming in high school when I learned the C language. Fascinated by being able to transform abstract mathematical concepts into concrete solutions, I decided to pursue this path.

After a 5-month intensive bootcamp in web development, I joined the **ADA Tech School** to deepen my skills in fullstack development, mastering languages such as **JavaScript**, **PHP** and **Java**. Through concrete projects, such as a Datavisualization application involving API manipulation or a back-office based on CRUD operations, I learned to solve complex problems while working in a team.

Today, I'm looking for a work-study position as a **fullstack web developer**, to put my skills into practice and continue to evolve on innovative projects, particularly in the development of real-time discussion applications.
